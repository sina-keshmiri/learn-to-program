/*
Implement a binary search function that takes an array of sorted numbers ('arr') and 
a target number ('target'). The function should return 'true' if the target number is present in the array and 'false' otherwise. 
Ensure that your solution has a time complexity of O(log n).

IMPORTANT NOTE TO THINK ABOUT IS: SORTED ARRAY ex: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10] target: 7
